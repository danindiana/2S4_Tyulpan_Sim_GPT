# 2S4_Tyulpan_Sim_GPT
A military computer simulation game for the firing of the 2S4 Tyulpan mortar-gun system.


Consider the 2S4 Tyulpan self-propelled mortar: This is a heavy, tracked self-propelled mortar with a 240 mm caliber, capable of firing various types of ammunition, including high-explosive, incendiary, and chemical rounds. The 2S4 Tyulpan has a maximum firing range of approximately 20 kilometers when using standard ammunition, and around 9-10 kilometers when using precision-guided munitions.

Let's create a military computer simulation game. We will start by generating python code that simulates the various features of firing the Russian 2S4 Tyulpan mortar gun-system. We want to model the firing of the gun by implementing all relevant physics factors. Our code should ask the user for the type of munition, the propellant charge, and angle of the mortar tube in order to hit the target. We can use the library matplotlib.
