To design a simple gun-laying system for the **2S4 Tyulpan** using C-like pseudocode, we will simulate the process of selecting the charge, laying degrees, and other parameters via a console interface. The system will prompt the user for input, validate the data, and display the selected configuration.

### **Explanation of the Pseudocode**

1. **Menu System**:
   - The program displays a menu with options for the user to select charge level, set elevation, set traverse, fire the mortar, or exit.

2. **Input Validation**:
   - The program validates user input for charge level, elevation, and traverse to ensure they fall within the allowable ranges for the 2S4 Tyulpan.

3. **Configuration**:
   - The user can configure the charge level (1–5), elevation (50–80 degrees), and traverse (0–10 degrees).

4. **Firing**:
   - Before firing, the program checks if all parameters (charge, elevation, traverse) have been configured. If not, it prompts the user to configure them.

5. **Exit**:
   - The user can exit the program by selecting the "Exit" option.

**Implementation of Hex-Based Mechanics in the 2S4 Tyulpan Mortar Simulation Game**

**Overview:**
To enhance the realism and strategic depth of the 2S4 Tyulpan mortar simulation game, we will implement hex-based mechanics using a hexagonal grid for positioning and targeting. This approach provides a balanced and intuitive system for movement and fire missions.

**Key Components:**

1. **Hex Grid System:**
   - Use axial coordinates (q, r) for hex identification.
   - Each hex represents a specific distance (e.g., 100 meters per side).

2. **Coordinate Conversion Functions:**
   - Convert axial coordinates to Cartesian for rendering:
     ```
     function axial_to_cartesian(q, r, size):
         x = q * (size * 3 / 2)
         y = r * (size * sqrt(3))
         return x, y
     ```
   - Convert Cartesian coordinates to axial for input handling:
     ```
     function cartesian_to_axial(x, y, size):
         q = (x / (size * 3 / 2)) - (y / (size * sqrt(3))) * 0.5
         r = y / (size * sqrt(3))
         return q, r
     ```

3. **User Interface (UI) Updates:**
   - Display hex grid overlay on the battlefield map.
   - Allow player to select target hexes directly.
   - Highlight target hexes and display relevant information (distance, direction).

4. **Fire Calculation Integration:**
   - Calculate distance and direction from mortar to target using hex coordinates.
   - Determine necessary charge and elevation angle for target distance.
   - Apply wind compensation based on wind direction and speed.

5. **Mission Objectives:**
   - Specify target locations using hex coordinates for precision.
   - Update feedback mechanisms to reflect hex-based positions.

6. **Testing and Optimization:**
   - Create test cases for various scenarios (short-range, long-range, wind conditions).
   - Optimize calculations for performance on large battlefields.
   - Ensure compatibility with existing features and functionalities.

**Flowchart for Firing Process:**

1. Player selects target hex.
2. Calculate Cartesian coordinates of target hex.
3. Determine distance and direction to target from mortar's position.
4. Calculate necessary charge and elevation angle for target distance.
5. Apply wind compensation based on wind direction and speed.
6. Simulate mortar fire and determine if shell lands within target hex.
7. Provide feedback on result (hit or miss) and mission impact.

**Conclusion:**
Implementing hex-based mechanics will significantly enhance the game's realism and strategic depth. By using axial coordinates and integrating them with existing features, the simulation will offer a more balanced and immersive experience for players. Thorough testing and documentation will ensure accuracy and performance across various scenarios.
