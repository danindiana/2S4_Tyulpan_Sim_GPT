## **Features**

### **1. Hex-Based Mechanics**
- **Hexagonal Grid System**: Every battlefield is divided into a hexagonal grid, providing a balanced and intuitive system for movement, targeting, and fire missions.
- **Precise Coordinates**: Use axial coordinates (q, r) to identify and target specific hexes, ensuring accuracy in your fire missions.
- **Distance and Direction Calculation**: Automatically calculate the distance and direction to target hexes, simplifying the process of adjusting charge levels and elevation angles.

### **2. Realistic Fire Missions**
- **Dynamic Scenarios**: Engage in a variety of missions, from neutralizing fortified positions to supporting infantry assaults and countering enemy artillery.
- **Environmental Factors**: Account for wind speed, direction, and terrain type to refine your fire settings and achieve precision.
- **Ammunition Management**: Choose between High-Explosive (HE), incendiary, and practice rounds, and manage your limited ammunition supply effectively.

### **3. Campaign Mode**
- **Five Real-World Missions**: Test your skills in five distinct missions inspired by real-world combat scenarios against NATO-type OPFOR forces.
  - **Mission 1**: Defensive Position Neutralization
  - **Mission 2**: Counter-Battery Fire
  - **Mission 3**: Supporting Infantry Assault
  - **Mission 4**: Interdiction of Reinforcements
  - **Mission 5**: Demolition of Command and Control Centers
- **Progressive Difficulty**: Each mission builds on the skills learned in the previous one, with increasing complexity and tactical challenges.

### **4. User Interface**
- **Hex Grid Overlay**: A clear hexagonal grid overlay on the battlefield map allows for precise targeting and movement.
- **Target Highlighting**: Target hexes are visually highlighted, with distance, direction, and other relevant information displayed for clarity.
- **Mission Briefing and Debriefing**: Before each mission, receive a detailed briefing on objectives and challenges. After each mission, review your performance and learn from your successes and mistakes.

### **5. Dynamic Difficulty System**
- **Adaptive Challenges**: The game adjusts the difficulty based on your performance, ensuring a balanced and engaging experience for players of all skill levels.
